# All the things that I need the code to do

Always start with the longest
    a single data frame with all data from all trials 


Functions:
    get_id_keys -> return a df  (the test should import pandas and include assert isinstance (   ,pandas.core.frame.DataFrame))
    deidentify -> return df    (the test should import pandas and include assert isinstance (   ,pandas.core.frame.DataFrame))
    get_response_df -> df with trial responses by ID of the anagram  
    json_utils.load_stimulus_json  -> gives us a list of dict
    get_stimulus_df -> returns a stimulus df
    




Notes to self:
    Id always refers to the ID of the anagram
